Spark twitter clone:

to run app:
npm install on client and server,
npm run build on client,
npm run start 

For the final project, I created a twitter clone. I changed my project purpose from my previous roommate finder app idea to this after remembering a simple mini twitter frontend design that I did for a practice project in Penn Spark last year. I ended up building off of the design to actually implement the frontend and backend using React, Node, and MongoDB. The application allows sign up/login/logout, posting tweets, liking tweets, following other users, viewing the posted feed (explore page), and editing personal profiles. The frontend includes components and the backend has signup/login/logout functionality, API calls, and integration with database.
